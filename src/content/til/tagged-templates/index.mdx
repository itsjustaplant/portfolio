While using styled-components, I was amazed by this ✨**super**✨ syntax that allow us to set component styles dynamically. I was wondering what that was and started looking for the answer.

```tsx
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: #BF4F74;
`;
```

Let's start with template literals first. 
<br />
Template literals are easy way to combine expressions with strings. This process is called _String Interpolation_.
<br />
```ts 
const username = "justaplant";
const prompt = `Hello, ${username}!`;
```
<br />
In this example, placeholder `${username}` will be replaced with `username`. Can you guess what the evaluated string will be? 
<br />
🥁🥁🥁 _drum rolls_ 🥁🥁🥁
<br />
You're right! The answer is `Hello, justaplant!`
<br />

Tagged Templates are basically advanced version of Template Literals that you can parse with functions.
