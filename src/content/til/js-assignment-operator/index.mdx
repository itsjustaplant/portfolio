While working on [Stencil](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/tree/main), i discovered that Javascript's assignment operator returns the assigned value. This behaviour allows us to reuse the result of the a function multiple times within a single line of code.

```ts
const slotName = (newChild['s-sn'] = getSlotName(newChild));
```
<p class="italic">You can view the whole code in [GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/blob/a7d38735a8572303fa2ea7e154e9a9dc3bf7eecb/src/runtime/dom-extras.ts#L255)</p>

In this code, we assign the return value of `getSlotName` to `slotName` and `'s-sn'` property of `newChild`.

After writing JS for few years, i almost forgot this thing and never used it before.

Is it good for readability, dx, efficiency? I am not sure... but it is fun to discover a little aspect of assignment operator.
