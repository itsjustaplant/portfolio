While using **styled-components**, I was amazed by this <Link href="https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#adapting-based-on-props" showIcon={false}>‚ú®**amazing**‚ú®</Link> syntax that allows us to set component styles dynamically. 

I was wondering what that was and started looking for the answer. Thanks to the great documentation of **style-components**, it didn't take too much time for me to figure out.

```tsx
const Button = styled.button<{ $primary?: boolean; }>`
  /* Adapt the colors based on primary prop */
  background: ${props => props.$primary ? "#BF4F74" : "white"};
  color: ${props => props.$primary ? "white" : "#BF4F74"};

  font-size: 1em;
  margin: 1em;
  padding: 0.25em 1em;
  border: 2px solid #BF4F74;
  border-radius: 3px;
`;

render(
  <div>
    <Button>Normal</Button>
    <Button $primary>Primary</Button>
  </div>
);
```
<br />
Before moving on to advanced use of string interpolation, let's start with template literals first. 
<br />
Template literals are easy way to combine expressions with strings. This process is called _String Interpolation_.
<br />
```ts 
const username = "justaplant";
const prompt = `Hello, ${username}!`;
```
<br />
In this example, placeholder `${username}` will be replaced with `username`. Can you guess what the evaluated string will be? 
<br />
ü•Åü•Åü•Å _drum rolls_ ü•Åü•Åü•Å
<br />
You're right! The answer is `Hello, justaplant!`
<br />

Tagged Templates are basically advanced version of Template Literals that you can parse with functions.
